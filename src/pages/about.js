              Hi, and thanks for sticking around! You probably would like to
              know more about me... I was a teacher in 2018 when I decided to
              switch careers and study to become a Full Stack Web Developer. My
              path to tech really started back in 2002 when I used be addicted
              to creating short cuts and command-lines for my mIRC .
            </p>

            <p className="about-paragraph">
              In 2019, I earned my Full Stack - Web Developer Certificate from
              the University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp. There I honed my skills
              in both Front and Back End technologies. I've always had a thirst
              to learn new things and the coding bootcamp started me on a new
              path to do exactly that - I am still constantly learning and
              working to add to my skillset.
            </p>

              Iâ€™m proud to say I have always left a positive mark in my past
              workplaces due to my ability to build good relationships with my
              coworkers. I'm always been known as a great team player. I'm
              originally from Brazil and have been living in the United States
              since 2015. When not coding I love to garden and play soccer.
