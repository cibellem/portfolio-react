              Hey there, thanks for sticking around! I'm Cibelle and I'm a Full
              Stack Javascript Developer who decided to make her addiction of
              creating short cuts and command-lines for my
              <a href="https://www.mirc.com/"> mIRC</a> into a profession. I'm a
              former teacher who loves being exposed to different concepts,
              cultures and people and I found in tech a place with endless
              oportunities to pursue that.

              I'm an effective learner who's continually looking for ways to
              grow both professionally and as a person. In each and every
              project I put my heart on it and my top priority is delivering a
              final product that goes above and beyond my customer's
              expectations. I'm currently proficient in the MERN Stack and very
              much interested to add more skills to my list.

              Iâ€™m proud to say I have always left a positive mark in my past
              workplaces due to my ability work colaboratively and to build good
              relationships with my coworkers. I'm always been known as a great
              team player. I'm a proud Brazilian and I have been living in the
              United States since 2015. When not coding I love to garden and
              play soccer. &#x1F60E;
